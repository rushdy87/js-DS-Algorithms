Recursion
  - a recursive function is a function that calls itself.

Rules of Recursion
  - Base Case
    * In recursion, there must be a base case (also 
      referred to as terminating case)
          function countDownToZero(n) {
            // base case. Stop at 0
            if (n <= 0) {
                return; // stop the function
            } else {
                console.log(n);
                countDownToZero(n - 1); // count down 1
            }
          }
          countDownToZero(12);
    * The base case for this function is when n is smaller or equal to 0.
  - Divide-and-Conquer Method
    * the divide-and-conquer method is when a problem is solved by solving 
      all of its smaller components.
