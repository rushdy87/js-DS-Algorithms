Encryption
  - TSL is a standard security technology for establishing an 
    encrypted link between the server and the client (browser).
    1. The server sends its asymmetric public key to the browser.
    2. The browser creates a symmetric key for the current 
      session, which is encrypted by the server’s asymmetric 
      public key.
    3. The server decrypts the browser’s session via its private 
      key and retrieves the session key.
    4. Both systems have the session key and will use this to 
      transmit data securely.
    If the browser was to connect to the same server the next day, 
    a new session key would be created.

RSA Encryption:
  - RSA is an encryption algorithm based on the difficulty of 
    factoring large integers.
  - There are three phases in the process: 
  - key generation, encryption, and decryption.
    Key generation: The public key (shared) and private key (kept 
    secret) are generated.
    Encryption: The secret message can be encrypted via the public key.
    Decryption: Only the private key can be used to decrypt the message.

Here’s an overview of the algorithm:
  1. Select two (usually large) prime numbers, p and q.
    a. The product of p and q is denoted as n.
    b. The product of (p-1) and (q-1) is denoted as phi.
  2. Choose two exponents, e and d.
    a. e is typically 3. Other values greater than 2 can be used.
    b. d is a value such that (e × d) % phi = 1.
Encryption process is as shown:
        m - message:
        m^e % n = c
        c - encrypted message
Decryption process is as shown:
        c^d % n = m
