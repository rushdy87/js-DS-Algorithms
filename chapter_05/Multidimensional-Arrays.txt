Multidimensional Arrays
  - JavaScript does not have multidimensional arrays.
  - Instead, there are “jagged” arrays.
    * A jagged array is an array whose elements are arrays.
    * The elements of a jagged array can be of different 
      dimensions and sizes.

        const jaggedArr = [
          [1, 2, 3],
          [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
          [1],
          [6, 7, 8]
        ];
