JavaScript Memory Management
_______________________________________________________
- In any program, a variable takes up some memory.
- the V8 JavaScript engine and other modern JavaScript 
  engines have garbage collectors that delete unused 
  variables for the programmer.

Memory Leaks
  - A memory leak is a failure in a program to release 
    discarded memory, causing impaired performance and 
    sometimes even failure.
  - Memory leaks can happen when JavaScript enginesâ€™ 
    garbage collectors do not free memory properly.

The delete Operator
  The delete operator can be used to delete an unwanted 
  object property.
      const obj = {
        prop: 'test'
      };
      console.log(obj.prop); // test
      delete obj.prop;
      console.log(obj.prop); // undefined
